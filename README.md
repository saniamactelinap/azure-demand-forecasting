# Azure Demand Forecasting & Capacity Optimization System

## Overview
This project focuses on building a data driven system to forecast **Azure Compute and Storage demand**
using historical usage data. The objective is to assist capacity planning teams in making informed
provisioning decisions, thereby reducing both **over provisioning** and **under provisioning**
of cloud infrastructure.

Since real Azure production data is confidential, representative **synthetic datasets** are used
to simulate realistic demand patterns across regions and services.

---

## Project Objectives
- Forecast Azure Compute and Storage demand accurately
- Support efficient capacity planning and provisioning decisions
- Improve utilization of cloud infrastructure
- Reduce cost impact caused by inaccurate demand estimation

---

## Scope of the Project
- Historical time series demand data (12–24 months)
- Multiple Azure regions
- Compute and Storage services only
- Focus on data preparation and modeling methodology

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels(ARIMA)
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- Feature Engineering Techniques  
- Machine Learning 
- Azure Machine Learning concepts

### Milestone 3: Machine Learning Model Development

The objective of this milestone was to **train and evaluate forecasting models** to predict Azure demand accurately.

#### Models Implemented

**1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- Traditional time series forecasting model
- Suitable for sequential demand patterns
- Tuned using parameter search for optimal (p,d,q) configuration

**2. XGBoost Regressor**
- Gradient boosting machine learning model
- Handles nonlinear patterns and feature interactions effectively
- Hyperparameter tuning performed using GridSearchCV

---

#### Model Evaluation Metrics
Models were evaluated using:

- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- Forecast comparison visualization
- Prediction vs Actual demand comparison

---

#### Model Comparison

The forecasting results showed:

- ARIMA produced smooth average forecasts
- XGBoost captured demand spikes and volatility more accurately

Therefore, **XGBoost was selected as the final forecasting model** due to its superior performance on the test dataset.

- Inspect trends and spikes with dynamic, interactive charts  

**2. Capacity Planning Insights**
- Identify periods of **over provisioning** and **under provisioning**  
- Detect **demand spikes** and **high volatility periods**  
- Recommend **resource allocation adjustments** to optimize utilization  

**3. Cost Analysis**
